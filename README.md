# CRTIMER
Talking CR Timer
This is my Talking CR Timer V1.1
It uses an Arduino Nano and has an onboard SD Card.
You can connect a speaker directly to the board ( non amplified audio) to play audio files from the SD Card
A ledstrip of 5 pixelleds ( WS2812 or simular) is used to illuminute the "level of stench"
The user can set the level of stench by pressing the button.
There is a timer in between levels of 3 mins...it will automatically scale down to the previous level until it is completly off.

Press on by pressing and holding the button until first pixelled lights up
Press it again to move to a higher level
Press and hold for 3 seconds to switch the unit off.
If the timer ends ( 3 minutes per stage) the unit will switch off.
